- [ ] Test website with `python website/app.py`

### 3. Repository Preparation
- [ ] Commit all changes to Git
- [ ] Push to GitHub/GitLab
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
- [ ] Update README with your business information

## üîç Testing Your Deployment

### Bot Testing
1. Search for your bot on Telegram
2. Send `/start` command
3. Test each menu option:
   - View Services
   - Place Order
   - Schedule a Talk
   - Message Me Directly
   - View Channel

### Website Testing
1. Visit your website URL
2. Test all forms:
   - Order form
   - Schedule form
   - Contact form
3. Verify Telegram notifications are received

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
Both services include health checks:
- **Bot**: Verifies process is running
- **Website**: Checks HTTP response from `/`

### Logs
Monitor application logs for:
- Error messages
- Failed notifications
- Database issues
- User interactions

### Database Maintenance
- Database is automatically initialized on first run
- SQLite file is persistent across deployments
- Consider regular backups for production

## üîí Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use secure secret keys
- Regularly rotate bot tokens if needed

### Database Security
- SQLite file should not be web-accessible
- Consider PostgreSQL for high-traffic deployments

### HTTPS
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Railway and Render provide automatic SSL

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not responding:**
- Check bot token is correct
- Verify admin chat ID
- Check deployment logs

**Website not loading:**
- Verify port configuration
- Check Flask environment variables
- Review build logs

**Database errors:**
- Ensure database directory exists
- Check file permissions
- Verify initialization script ran

**Notifications not working:**
- Verify bot token and admin chat ID
- Check network connectivity
- Review Telegram API rate limits

### Getting Help
- Check deployment platform documentation
- Review application logs
- Test locally with same environment variables
- Verify all dependencies are installed

## üìà Scaling and Optimization

### Performance Tips
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Monitor resource usage
- Consider database optimization for high volume

### Advanced Deployments
- Set up staging environments
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Use database migrations
- Add monitoring and alerting

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### Updating the Application
1. Make changes to your local repository
2. Test changes locally
3. Commit and push to your repository
4. Platform will auto-deploy (if configured)
5. Monitor deployment logs
6. Test updated functionality

### Database Updates
- Changes to database schema require migration scripts
- Always backup database before major updates
- Test schema changes in staging first
